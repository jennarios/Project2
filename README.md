# Gryffendor - Project 2
Our project 2 consists of 4 team members, one client, and two week completion window.

    - Products
    - etc
## Process Automation

- The after save flow process, allowed a trigger to be fired when an Opportunity was 'Closed-Won'. Sending a 'Opportunity has been Closed' email to the opportunity Account Owner.
